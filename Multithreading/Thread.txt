In Java, a thread is a lightweight unit of execution — simply put, it's a separate path of execution inside a program. Multiple threads allow a program to perform multiple tasks simultaneously (or seemingly at the same time through time-slicing).

✅ Simple Definition

A thread in Java is like a mini-program running inside a larger program.

✅ Why Do We Use Threads?
Without Threads	With Threads
Tasks run one after another	Tasks can run simultaneously
Example: First download file → THEN play music	Example: Download file while playing music
Less responsive UI	More responsive & faster performance
✅ Real-Life Example

Think of a kitchen in a restaurant:

One Chef (Single Thread) → Cook food one order at a time

Multiple Chefs (Multi-threading) → Cook multiple orders at once
