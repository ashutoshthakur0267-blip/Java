✅ Thread Life Cycle in Java
State	Description	How It Enters This State
1. New (Born)	Thread is created but not yet started.	When you create a Thread object using new Thread()
2. Runnable (Ready to Run)	The thread is eligible to run, waiting for CPU time.	When you call start()
3. Running	The thread is actively executing its run() method.	When CPU scheduler picks the thread
4. Blocked / Waiting / Timed Waiting	Thread is temporarily inactive, waiting for some condition (sleep, I/O, lock, wait()).	- sleep(ms) → Timed Waiting
- wait() → Waiting
- Waiting for I/O or monitor lock → Blocked
5. Terminated / Dead	Thread has finished execution and cannot be restarted.	run() method ends or stop() is called
