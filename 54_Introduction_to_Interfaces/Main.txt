Great question 👍

In Java,

Abstract classes and Interfaces are used to achieve abstraction and polymorphism — they define what derived classes must implement, without giving full implementation details.

In C++, we achieve the same concepts using abstract classes and pure virtual functions.

🔹 1. Abstract Class in C++

In C++, an abstract class is a class that contains at least one pure virtual function.

Syntax:

class Shape {
public:
    virtual void draw() = 0;  // pure virtual function
};


➡️ The = 0 means it’s a pure virtual function — no implementation in the base class.

Derived classes must override it:

class Circle : public Shape {
public:
    void draw() override {
        cout << "Drawing Circle" << endl;
    }
};


Key points:

You cannot create an object of an abstract class.

It can have both implemented and pure virtual functions (like Java abstract classes).

Use it when you want to define a common base but allow derived classes to provide specific implementations.

🔹 2. Interface Equivalent in C++

C++ doesn’t have a separate interface keyword.
But an interface in Java can be mimicked by a C++ abstract class with only pure virtual functions.

Example:

class Drawable {
public:
    virtual void draw() = 0;
    virtual void resize() = 0;
    virtual ~Drawable() {}  // always good to have a virtual destructor
};


Then implement it:

class Rectangle : public Drawable {
public:
    void draw() override {
        cout << "Drawing Rectangle" << endl;
    }
    void resize() override {
        cout << "Resizing Rectangle" << endl;
    }
};


✅ This behaves like a Java interface —

No data members

Only pure virtual methods

Derived classes must implement all functions

🔸 Summary Table
Concept	Java	Equivalent in C++
Abstract class	abstract class Shape { ... }	class Shape { virtual void draw() = 0; };
Interface	interface Drawable { ... }	class Drawable { virtual void method() = 0; }; (all pure virtual)
Implementation required in subclass?	Yes	Yes
Multiple inheritance	Interfaces only	Yes, supported for all classes
